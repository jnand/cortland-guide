Introduction
------------

This guide is a starting point for hardening macOS against common security issues. 
Its based on the 2016 NSA security guide (since unavailable), the NIST 
IT advisory, and the Defense Information Systems Agency OS X Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), in addition to a collection of blogs and articles cited
in the references section. Much of which is from [DrDuh's security guide](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/README.md).


As you progress through the guide each successfully implemented section will advance 
the "security level" of your macOS device. Completing the entire guide should bring
you up to [NIST CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/) recommended guidelines.


Assumptions
-----------

2. You have backups of critical data.
3. You accept the **'as is'** nature of this document.
4. **You** accept all responsibility in case you brick your device.
