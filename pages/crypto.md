Cryptographic methods
=====================


Applying cryptographic methods are a crucial part of securing any system, not just data at rest or in transit, but creating strong verifiable proof of identity for authentication and authorization tasks. We'll be taking careful consideration of how encryption integrates into each aspect of our strategy to derisk our threat model; data at rest, in transit, identity proofs, and password storage/generation.
